          <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project was to simulate being in a small development team. After sorting out a studio/team name, we made a small two-page pitch document, which we had to present in a pitch meeting with a "publisher" (the project lecturer). When the pitch was approved, we spent a further couple of weeks planning the development time frame, fleshing out mechanics, and assigning development roles. Due to the small size of the team, we had to have multiple roles each. My roles in the project were project manager/producer, economy and AI designer/developer, and mathematician.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Development took around 8 months. As project manager, I was responsible for ensuring our goals were met on time. This was mainly done with weekly scrum meetings, Kanban boards, and breaking larger goals into smaller, more manageable chunks. As Producer, I was responsible for identifying mechanics that should be cut to save time, updating the GDD, and keeping the "publisher" updated on development by hosting demos at expected milestones. In my development roles, I developed the game's turn-based economy and the functions required for the other members to use the economy with their mechanics (e.g., army upkeep), several helper math functions (i.e., population growth/army damage equations), and finally AI.</div>
            <div class = "body-text">Unfortunately, on the final day before our demo, while we were doing some last-minute testing and bug fixing of the AI, combat, and tutorial, we noticed a bug where during settlement generation, there was a chance for an out-of-bounds array error to crash the game. While investigating, I found out that this had a roughly 1/16 chance of happening in the dev build; however, it had a 100% chance of happening in the release version. Obviously this was a serious bug, and I attempted to fix this, but as it was discovered around 4 AM in a large file in which I was unfamiliar, without any help from Unreal Engine error messages, I was unable to fix it in time. After graduation, I passed on my notes of the bug to another developer who was more familiar with the file; the bug was fixed, and we have some small plans to expand upon Demense. </div>

    <div id="project-features-economy">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Features: Economy & Turn System</div>
        <div class="project-features-economy-details">
            <div class="body-text">As of writing, Demesne features two resources, Ducats/Gold and Food. Both the player and AI are affected by the economy, which is required to expand. The economy changes each turn. In code, the economy is a struct that contains TMaps for every value required for the economy to function. The reason for the TMaps is so we can assign a PlayerID to each value so we could modify a specific value for a specific player in random events (unfortunately cut for time). The economy file also comes with a large amount of helper files, allowing developers of other mechanics to easily modify a specific player's balance (i.e., removing a lump sum and increasing upkeep). In order for the economy to function in-game, it is required that the EconomyManager and TurnManager be present in the scene. When the Turn Manager sends an "end-turn" signal to the economy, then all of the upkeep and income values are used to generate a revenue value, which is added to the balance. From the GameMode file, the starting balances and AI Modifier can be set. This can make the economy easier or harder for the AI (by default the AI gets 1.25X more income than the player).</div>
            <div class="body-text">The TurnManager is very simple; once the End Turn button is pressed, the TurnManager broadcasts a multicast delegate notifying everything subscribed that the player has ended their turn. It also switches a StateMachine to say it is the AI's turn for a small amount of time before reverting it back to the player's turn state.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div id="project-features-AI">
            <div class="subheader-text">Project Features: AI & other features</div>
            <div class="project-features-economy-details">
                <div class="body-text"> Demesne features a basic strategy. AI that can utilise the economy, settlement, and army mechanics, albeit not as well as the player can, and to compensate receives 25% extra income per turn compared to the player. The AI utilises Blackboard, behaviour trees (shown below), and tasks written in C++ to function. Like the economy, the AI is turn-based, using a boolean that is set to true when the TurnState is not set to Player and set to false when the tree has been run through; this prevents it from taking multiple turns for each of the players turns. The AI behaviour is split into two phases: economic and military. In the economic phase, the AI checks its income, upkeep, and balance, then sets the relevant blackboard keys. It then checks if any of its settlements has an affordable building to construct, and finally, it checks if it is bankrupt (consequences of which are not yet implemented; it will likely give the AI a loan when that feature is added). In the military phase, the AI creates a new unit if at all affordable (type chosen at random), then it randomly moves its units or attempts combat if in range, and then finally it ends its turn.</div>
                <div class="body-text">There are other features I worked on that I feel do not require their own section. The first thing we will talk about is the main menu and EndTurn/Resource bar, both of which I designed and scripted. There is also the MathHelper file, which contains all of the mathematical equations for the economy and population as well as the upcoming banking system. Many of these equations I formulated and tested myself, based either on a simplified version of financial equations or based in part on equations found in similar games. Finally, I was in charge of the historical research for the game, creating a list of 60+ potential city names that are appropriate for the mediaeval setting.</div>
