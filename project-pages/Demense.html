        <div class="project-post-mortem-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project was to simulate being in a small development team. After sorting out a studio/team name, we made a small two page pitch document which we had to present in a pitch meeting with a "publisher" (the project lecturer).When the pitch was approved we spent a further couple of weeks planning the development time frame, fleshing out mechanics, and assigned development roles. Due to the small size of the team we had to have multiple roles each. My roles in the project were: Project Manager/Producer, Economy and AI Designer/Developer, Mathematician.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Development took around 8 months, as Project Manager I was responsible for ensuring our goals were met on time, this was mainly done with weekly scrum meetings, Kanban boards and breaking larger goals into smaller, more manageable chunks.As Producer I was responsible for identifying mechanics that should be cut to save time, updating the GDD as well as keeping the "publisher" updated on development by hosting demos at expected milestones. In my development roles I developed the games turn based economy and the functions required for the other members to use the economy with their mechanics (e.g. army upkeep), several helper math functions (i.e population growth/army damage equations) and finally created an admittedly basic turn based AI </div>
            <div class="body-text">The development of the project progressed fairly steadily with few issues until the closing weeks of the project. Updates the the project repository were fairly consistent (several times per week), using branches for each major mechanic (i.e a branch for the economy and another for map generation) to prevent overwriting of work and weekly SCRUM meeting online and more common,informal meetings offline. Aside from the occasional GitHub related issue,everyone was able to contribute a fair share of work without issue and communication was consistent and common, using discord to ask for help, share ideas and report issues.Although I was the Project Manager, I kept the allocation of tasks fairly democratic, allowing the team to choose mechanics they were interested in, however in the rare cases when two or more people wanted to do a mechanic or no one wanted to do a mechanic, I was the one with the final decision. In these cases, job allocation was done via experience with similar mechanics or failing that who I believed could get it done the fastest with minimal issues. To prevent accusations of favouritism in areas that had no volunteers or people with experience I volunteered as was the case with AI. This sometimes lead to issues with stress, being overworked and a caffeine addiction, but I firmly believe it was the right decision to maintain team cohesion and morale.</div>
            <div class = "body-text">Unfortunately on the final day before our demo, while we were doing some last-minute testing and bug fixing of the AI, combat and tutorial, we noticed a bug where during settlement generation, there was a chance for an out of bounds array error to crash the game. While investigating I found out that this had a roughly 1/16 chance of happening in the dev build, however it had a 100% chance of happening in the release version. Obviously this was a serious bug and I attempted to fix this but as it was discovered around 4 AM in a large file in which I was unfamiliar, without any help from Unreal Engine error messages I was unable to fix it in time. After graduation, I passed on my notes of the bug to the developer of that file and the issue is currently being fixed, at which point I will change the Repo link to the new repo fork. </div>

        <div class="project-features-economy-details">
            <div class="body-text">As of writing, Demesne features two resources, Ducats/Gold and Food. Both the player and AI are effected by the economy, which is required to expand. The economy changes each turn.In code the economy is a struct that contains TMaps for every value required for the economy to function. The reason for the TMaps is so we can assign a PlayerID to each values so we could modify a specific value for a specific player in random events (unfortunately cut for time). The economy file also comes with a large amount of helper files, allowing developers of other mechanics to easily modify a specific players balance (i.e removing a lump sum and increasing upkeep). In order for the economy to function in game, it is required that the EconomyManager and TurnManager are present in the scene. When the Turn Manager sends a "end-turn" signal to the economy then all of the upkeep and income values are used to generate a Revenue value which is added to the balance. From the GameMode file, the starting balances and AI Modifier can be set. This can make the economy easier or harder for the AI(by default the AI gets 1.25X more income than the player)  </div>
            <div class="body-text">The TurnManager is very simple, once the End Turn button is pressed TurnManager broadcasts a multicast delegate notifying everything subscribed that the player has ended their turn. It also switches a StateMachine to say it is the AIs turn for a small amount of time, before reverting it back to the Players turn State. </div>
