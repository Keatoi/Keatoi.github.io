          <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project was to simulate being in a small development team. After sorting out a studio/team name, we made a small two page pitch document which we had to present in a pitch meeting with a "publisher" (the project lecturer).When the pitch was approved we spent a further couple of weeks planning the development time frame, fleshing out mechanics, and assigned development roles. Due to the small size of the team we had to have multiple roles each. My roles in the project were: Project Manager/Producer, Economy and AI Designer/Developer, Mathematician.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Development took around 8 months, as Project Manager I was responsible for ensuring our goals were met on time, this was mainly done with weekly scrum meetings, Kanban boards and breaking larger goals into smaller, more manageable chunks.As Producer I was responsible for identifying mechanics that should be cut to save time, updating the GDD as well as keeping the "publisher" updated on development by hosting demos at expected milestones. In my development roles I developed the games turn based economy and the functions required for the other members to use the economy with their mechanics (e.g. army upkeep), several helper math functions (i.e population growth/army damage equations) and finally created an admittedly basic turn based AI </div>
