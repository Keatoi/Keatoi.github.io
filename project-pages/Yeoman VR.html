          <div class="body-text">An archery trainer I made for my third-year dissertation, designed for the Quest 2 and using realistic ballistics and scoring based on my own experience as an archer and using scientific and historical data. In all, the game includes three functional bows, multiple arrow types, a magnified bow sight, and three different ranges (one with tournament scoring, one with obstructed targets and moving targets, and an outdoor range with wind).</div>
          <div class="body-text">Unfortunately, the project requires the now-defunct Oculus XR plugin and Unreal Engine 5.0 to load up, but just in case you are able to run it, I have included the GitHub above. In truth, although I am proud I was able to make a working VR game for a Quest 2 without any obvious performance issues, this is certainly not my favourite project; its construction is around 70% blueprint and 30% C++, and I tend to prefer C++ outside of prototyping. However, there were issues with the Oculus C++ libraries at the time, if my memory serves correct, and so I had to use a large amount of BP to compensate. Furthermore, there are some bugs I was never able to complete on time, which, although they don't affect the playability of the game too much, are annoying. Ideally, one day I'll be able to revisit the concept and remake it with the skills I have achieved since then and a more stable engine version.</div>
