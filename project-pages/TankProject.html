          <div class="body-text">This project was inspired by leading tank multiplayer games such as Warthunder and World of Tanks, as well as my previous project YeomanVR, which used some custom penetration mechanics. The challenge was to try to get as close as possible to the main mechanics of these games with long development times with custom engines and a large team/budget using a free engine (UE5), no other developers, free assets, and a short development time of just a few months. Overall it was mostly a success; I ended up having to cut some things for time, such as the round bouncing around inside the tank and spalling. In addition, the demo is fairly rudimentary (due to spending a lot of time figuring out how to get a ChaosVehicle AI working without a set track) and requires some more work before I can truly consider this project complete.</div>
          
          <div class="body-text">While I am generally happy with the project, I am disappointed I wasn't able to get 100% of the things I wished to implement done. My belief is that this was mostly due to using a lot of modules I had never used prior to the project (Chaos Vehicles, Niagara, etc.) to make mechanics. I only had a vague idea of how to implement this; this led to using several weeks at least to learn and bugfix what could have otherwise been a fairly simple thing to implement (e.g., figuring out how to make the Chaos Vehicle player move took about a day and took around 4 weeks to figure out why the AI Chaos Vehicle wouldn't move). My adherence to real-life ballistics values probably hurt the project too, as it was difficult to see the projectiles moving at their real speed, and there are certain spots on the tank that seem like they would penetrate but in real life are unlikely to due to various factors. Ideally, at some point in the future, I would like to revisit this project to improve the demo to the point of it being playable without the use of the editor and to also include the missing features I had originally intended.   </div>
