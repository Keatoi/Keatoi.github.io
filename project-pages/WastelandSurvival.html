            <div class="body-text">This project was created for AVImmerse. They specified that they wanted a five-minute demo made according to their project brief. The brief was pretty broad, as it was given to multiple teams. My team produced an FPS survival game, while others produced a narrative 2D base builder, a strategy game, and a 2D farming sim.</div>
            <div class="body-text">Our demo contains the following mechanics: melee and ranged combat, basic animal AI, a day/night cycle, a calendar, a weather system, NPCs (hostile and friendly), and base building. Some of these features are only partially implemented, as we only focused on aspects that would appear in the demo.</div>
            <div class="body-text">My roles in this project were team leader and lead programmer. I was chosen for these roles as I was the most experienced member of the project (the rest of the team was primarily made up of undergrads). In brief, my responsibilities included team administration (setting up meetings, task prioritisation and assignment, scope control, etc.) as well as developing several of the mechanics (day/night cycle, calendar, weather system, animal AI, player and combat mechanics) and aiding the other developers where possible.</div>
            <div class="body-text">In retrospect, this project went fairly well, although it obviously requires some more polish, particularly in the animation and lighting departments. The artist portion of the team desired to use first-party assets where possible, and animation was one of the skill sets missing from the group. The mechanics were also designed around being in a 5-minute demo, so they would require some adjustments if the project were to be published; for example, more weather types would have to be added. In the final meeting with the client, these areas for improvement were communicated, and the demo was received rather well.</div>
