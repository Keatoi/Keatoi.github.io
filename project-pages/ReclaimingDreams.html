While the bulk of the project was done, there were some still outstanding tasks that were required.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The project was used on a Quest 3 so Optimisation was a top priority. Using Unity's profiler, I was able to ascertain what were the biggest obstacles for performance and develop a plan on how to tackle them. By far, the biggest impact on performance was Mesh rendering and skinning, primarily dealt with by a freelance 3D artist, or by myself via deleting unseen and unused assets or enabling GPU Instancing where required. The rest of Optimisation mainly came down to lighting, so the number of lights in each were reduced if possible as well as baking lighting to cut down on render calls. Aside from that there was a small amount code optimisation to be done, mostly by cutting unused update calls or changing operations to be more efficient. I also implemented new features such as a Locomotion Switch, head collison detection and some post processing as well as improving already present mechanics to suit the clients needs. </div>
